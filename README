Welcome to Zollern.

Zollern is a useless but fun programming environment.

* Bootstrapping

Z0 is a macro assembler written in C.  It outputs a ELF executable.
Z1 is a primitive, interactive programming environment written in Z0.
It has a bad compiler for a simple, but extensible langugae.  Z1 is
then used to build up a nice environment, by adding a better compiler
and extending the language.
